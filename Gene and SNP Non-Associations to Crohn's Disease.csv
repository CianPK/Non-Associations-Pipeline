For example, a power calculation, which assumed an OR of 1.2 and an allele frequency of 0.20 for the rarest IL12B variant rs3212227, demonstrated that our study had 63.1% power to detect a nominal significant finding (alpha = 0.05) in the CD cohort but had only a power of 38.2% in the UC cohort. However, based on the results of this study, the strength of a potential association of IL12B with IBD is several log-fold weaker than that shown for IL23R in our cohort [6] and other major CD susceptibility genes such as NOD2 and ATG16L1 (Supplemental Table S3), suggesting a more important role for IL-23R than IL-12/23 p40 in the genetic susceptibility to IBD. This is in agreement with the recent IBD meta-analyses [9], [10], which showed much stronger IBD association signals for IL23R than for IL12B. Similarly, smaller studies failed to show an association of IL12B SNPs with IBD or showed only weak associations with CD or UC [46], [47], [48] (see Supplemental Table S4 for an overview on published studies on IL12B in IBD). Even large studies such as the study by Festen et al., which included 1,455 UC patients and 1,902 controls, was unable to show an association of IL12B with UC [49], further demonstrating that very large patient cohorts are necessary to show convincing associations with this gene locus. Therefore, IL23R is a more important genetic modifier of IBD susceptibility than IL12B, suggesting a more important pathogenic role of Th17 cells, which express IL-23R, than Th1 cells, which develop under the control of IL-12."
PMC3316707,['rs6887695'],Crohn's disease,Caucasian,No significant association,"In summary, in contrast to Th17 cell-modifying and strongly IBD-associated IL23R gene variants, IL12B variants have a lesser role in the susceptibility to CD and UC in the German population, suggesting a more important role of IL-23R-expressing Th17 cells than Th1 cells in the CD pathogenesis. This observation is supported by similar results of large GWAS [5], [9], [10], in which IL23R showed stronger associations with IBD susceptibility than IL12B, although these GWAS clearly established IL12B as IBD susceptibility gene."
